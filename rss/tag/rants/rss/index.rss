I’m saying this literally of course, my current job involves me in having to learn new stuff and implement that knowledge quickly into practice. Working as web developer is tedious enough now that I’m getting to grips with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be absolutely frank, it’s not that hard but the whole process can be exhausting. It’s basically coding/implementing something and then testing it to see if it outputs what you want. Not too complicated, although I am now required to be make the transition to mobile development, and to be frank I don’t have prior experience in making apps. Its something I always wanted to learn but in a more controlled and relaxed manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making apps for smartphones in theory doesn’t sound complicated as it is quite similar to building sites. For example, I put a button here, it triggers an event or action, I swipe screen it should carry the same action as flipping the page using a button. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple right? The hardest part of the transition to mobile app is debugging, sometimes you get stuck when functions you put here and there end up conjuring numerous compile errors and given that you’re not totally familiar with the whole IDE or it’s language, it can be tough to rectify errors and move forward to implement other requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was planning to use this site for musings but now it ends up turning into a virtual rant booth. Forgive me it won’t happen again, I promise. I’ll never rant about work again. ;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss></html>
